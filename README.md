  - **📊 Sentiment Analysis API**  
    A FastAPI-based web service that analyzes text sentiment using machine learning models. The API preprocesses text by removing HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords, then applies lemmatization before classification. It supports multiple ML models (Logistic Regression) and vectorization techniques (TF-IDF) with pre-trained models stored as pickle files. Features include automatic text cleaning, NLTK integration for natural language processing, and a clean REST API with Swagger documentation.
    
    **Tech Stack:** FastAPI, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Python, Swagger UI
